# Bayesian

This is a group project that was done for a course in Bayesian statistics at the University of Texas at San Antonio (fall 2020). With two of my classmates, Ben Graf and Cong Zhang, I investigated frequentist and Bayesian approaches to analyze energy efficiency data in building construction. For this project, we used energy efficiency data from Tsanas and Xifara (2012) (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Energy+efficiency).

I am attaching our final project as a pdf file and our Rmarkdown file for the analysis.
